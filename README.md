# Help-Desk-Application

This application was created over the course of 4 months and building each logical tier, understanding how full-stack applications work. If you want to run this, its run from MS Visual Studio IDE (can't be run by index.html) and you will need to create a sql database and run the script provided. This application has full CRUD capabilities. Currently it is lacking in the visual department, but...that is for another time.
